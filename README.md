  Gramado interpreter for Linux.
  This is an interpreter, it reads a given file written in a c-like language and 
  print the information into a html formated file.

Step 1:
 + Create the command ./gramado
Step 2:
 + Go to build/ folder and type make to generate the html file.
   At this moment the ./gramado command will read a file called example.cnf 
   and create a file called index.html. Then you can open this file in 
   your web browser.

  $ make
  $ cd build/
  # make

```
